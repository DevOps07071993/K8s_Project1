Install latest awscli updated version
AWSCLI - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html
#aws --version
Install kubectl latest version
KUBECTL - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/install-kubectl.html
#kubectl version
1. Setup kubectl 
   a. Download latest kubectl version 
   b. Grant execution permissions to kubectl executable   
   c. Move kubectl onto /usr/local/bin (This is the default path of unix operating system)
   d. Test that your kubectl installation was successful
Refer link: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/install-kubectl.html
#curl -o kubectl https://amazon-eks.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1.21.2/2021-07-05/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl
#chmod +x ./kubectl
#mv ./kubectl /usr/local/bin 
#kubectl version
2. Setup eksctl (eksctl is the utility which helps us to setup the cluster then only we can use kubectl commands to manage our cluster)
EKSCTL -  
   a. Download and extract the latest release   
   b. Move the extracted binary to /usr/local/bin   
   c. Test that your eksclt installation was successful
Refer Link: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eksctl.html
#curl --silent --location "https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl/releases/latest/download/eksctl_$(uname -s)_amd64.tar.gz" | tar xz -C /tmp
#sudo mv /tmp/eksctl /usr/local/bin
#eksctl version
Before creating cluster we need to setup IAM role and assign all executive permissions
3. Create an IAM Role and attache it to EC2 instance  
   IAM FULL ACCESS
   EC2 FULL ACCESS   
   CloudFormation FULL ACCESS
eksctl_role - add it to bootstrap server (Bootstrap server have access to all the aws services because e have given adminidstarive access)
From the bootstrap image i am going to create the cluster
4. Create your cluster and nodes 
#eksctl create cluster --name devopstraining --region us-east-1 --node-type t2.small

Go and search cloudformation because eksctl is going to create environment with help of cloudformation. we could able to see cloudformation template
we could able to see default nodes 2 and also imp file to access the kubernetes cluster whoever have this file they can communicate with our cluster to do the activities.
cat /root/.kube/config
This is the cloud formation template completed successfully
goback to ec2 service - 2instances created and check with cli as well(#kubectl get nodes)
#kubectl get nodes
Now cluster is ready
#kubectl get all
